### Summary of article (200 words):

This article, written by Matthew Guariglia, draws on the terrorist attacks in recent years to raise the point that surveillance cameras do not play their role effectively and invade people's privacy too much. Then the author uses the methods of preventing terrorist attacks in the past to prove its inefficiency and gives his own ideas.
For one thing, he argues, surveillance cameras capture too many non-threatening people's movements, violating their privacy and making screening suspects too much work. This is a problem that the federal government has faced in the last century. They used criminal galleries to screen suspects, but with so many samples, the police have lost the ability to tell the difference between people. Later fingerprint collection is a good plan in the short term, but with the increase of data collection, there is no guarantee to find out the information of suspects effectively, which leads to the failure to arrest the criminals of terrorist attacks. The author thinks that although the speed of scientific and technological development is very fast, it still fails to fundamentally solve the problem. Government agencies and organizations need to focus on how to find criminals more efficiently, rather than more cameras to invade the privacy of ordinary people to protect their lives and security.
