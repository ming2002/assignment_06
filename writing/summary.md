### Citation of article:

After terrorist attacks in Boston, Orlando and Manchester, authorities informed the public that they “were aware” of the perpetrator months or even years before the violence occurred. Time and time again we learn that informants — clergy, neighbors, family members — filed reports with authorities, only to see those names end up on a never-ending list that, as journalists have shown, includes hundreds of thousands of innocent people.
An intelligence system that is overextended is also ineffective and dangerous. As NSA-contractor-turned-whistleblower Edward Snowden argued, “We’re monitoring everybody’s communications, instead of suspects’ communications. That lack of focus has caused us to miss leads that we should’ve had.” Pointing to Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev, Snowden said, “If we hadn’t spent so much on mass surveillance, if we had followed the traditional models, we might’ve caught him.”

### Why is this article relevant to the thesis of your Assignment 05?

This article mainly describes how the American police and government agencies prevent and investigate terrorist attacks in recent years, and discusses the drawbacks of these methods. By reading this article, I can understand why we need video surveillance and the history of similar technologies


### Summary of article (200 words):

This article, written by Matthew Guariglia, draws on the terrorist attacks in recent years to raise the point that surveillance cameras do not play their role effectively and invade people's privacy too much. Then the author uses the methods of preventing terrorist attacks in the past to prove its inefficiency and gives his own ideas.
For one thing, he argues, surveillance cameras capture too many non-threatening people's movements, violating their privacy and making screening suspects too much work. This is a problem that the federal government has faced in the last century. They used criminal galleries to screen suspects, but with so many samples, the police have lost the ability to tell the difference between people. Later fingerprint collection is a good plan in the short term, but with the increase of data collection, there is no guarantee to find out the information of suspects effectively, which leads to the failure to arrest the criminals of terrorist attacks. The author thinks that although the speed of scientific and technological development is very fast, it still fails to fundamentally solve the problem. Government agencies and organizations need to focus on how to find criminals more efficiently, rather than more cameras to invade the privacy of ordinary people to protect their lives and security.
